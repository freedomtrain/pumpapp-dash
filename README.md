# Pump Monitoring App
An application for energy efficiency and performance monitoring of a pump system, made with Dash. As part of a Industrial Internet of Things system, this app serves as the application layer. Using MQTT messaging protocol, the app receives sensor and instrument data installed on a pump system and display the processed data in a web- based application.

This app is still on the development stage and should be not deployed publicly as I have not implemented the security yet.
